Wu\\' Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton NY, USA, IBNL and Indiana University Abstract. We report on recent progress toward development of secondary emission \"amplifiers\" for photocathodes. Secondary emission gain of over 300 has been achieved in transmission mode and emission mode for a variety of diamond samples. Techniques of sample preparation, including hydrogenation to achieve negative electron affinity (NEA), have been adapted to this application. Keywords: Photoinjector, Diamond, Secondary Emitter, Cathode. PACS: 81.05.Uw DIAMOND AMPLIFIED PROTOINJECTOR This paper provides an overview of the ongoing effort to produce a diamond amplified photoinjector [1-3]. This injector would produce an electron bunch from a photocathode, accelerate this bunch to a few keV, and pass the beam into a thin diamond slab. The primary electrons lose their energyin the first fraction of a micron of travel primarily via electron-electron scattering, producing electron-hole pairs. The diamond is biased such that the electrons flow to the far side, where they are emitted from a specially-prepared, negative electron-affinity (NEA) surface into vacuum. A diagram illustrating this process is shown in figure 1. Photocathode Diamond Primary Secondary electrons electrons Primary Secondary electrons electrons Thin Metal Layer Hydrogen (10-30 nm) Termination Diamond (15 um) 3-10KV FIGURE 1. Schematic of capsule photocathode (left) and magnified view of diamond window (right). The diamond acts as a vacuum barrier as well as an amplifier, protecting the cathode from the injector vacuum. The primary electron side of the diamond must be metallized to allow the holes to be neutralized and to provide the accelerating gradient \\nfor the primary electrons. This metallization layer affects the band structure of the diamond near the surface; thus the choice of metal and deposition technique is critical [4]. The emission side of the diamond must be hydrogen (or cesium) terminated to achieve an NEA surface [5]. To address these challenges, a research program has been developed to characterize various diamonds and investigate their performance as secondary emitters. Results for three classes of diamond are presented, and electron gain is characterized in two geometries emission (electrons emitted into vacuum) and transmission (electrons conducted through bulk diamond). EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT Three types of diamonds were investigated in this study. One was a type Ila natural diamond with a 110 crystalline orientation purchased from UralAlmazInvest. This diamond was 2.6x3x.16 mm Two diamonds were CVD grown synthetic diamonds from Harris InternationalEleement Six (HI/E6). One was polycrystalline electronic grade (typical grain size ~100um) with dimensions of 5mm diameter, 0.15 mm thick. The other was a 4x4x0.16 mm\\' detector grade single crystal with a 1,0,0 orientation. Characterization These diamonds were characterized via FTIR and Ramun//ierolumineeccccr (R/PL). The FTIR spectrum of each diamond is shown in figure 2. The structure of these spectra is characteristic of the diamond lattice, with the exception of the peak at 1282cm\" in the natural diamond spectrum. The amplitude of this peak corresponds to ~30ppm of type IaA nitrogen aggregate impurity, a typical impurity in natural diamond [6]. The synthetic diamond have no observable peaks in the nitrogen region, 1100cm\" and 1300cm\", implying the nitrogen impurity levels are <l ppm, consistent with the manufacturer specifications. The R/PL spectra are consistent with these nitrogen levels, and are not shown. 20 2.

Preparation of Diamond In preparation for electron amplification studies, the diamonds were etched in a standard process [2] to remove graphite, metal, organic and inorganic contamination \\nand establish C-O bond on the diamond surface. For diamonds measured in transmission mode (TM), both broad faces of the diamond were metallized, leaving a rim near the side of the diamond to prevent surface flashovers. The specifics of the metallization vary with each diamond sample, and are detailed in measurements section. For diamonds measured in emission mode (EM), one surface was hydrogenated. This was done by baking the diamond to over 400C in 5nTorr vacuum to break existing C-O bonds on the surface. The sample was allowed to cool, and luTorr of H2 was introduced to the system. A tungsten filament about 2.5cm from the diamond was heated to 1800C to crack the molecular hydrogen. The diamond was exposed to the cracked hydrogen for 20 minutes. Measurement System The measurement apparatus consisted of a 2nTorr vacuum system housing an electron gun, and a sample holder. The DC electron gun was capable of emitting electron beams of up to 5keV. The diamond samples were held in a mount (figure 3) that provided electrical isolation of the primary and secondary electrodes. Emission Mode Transmission Mode Kapton Diamond: Red areas are metallized FIGURE3. Cross-section of diamond mount for emission (left) and transmission (right) mode. In both cases the primary and secondary electrodes are stainless steel. For transmission measurements, electrical contact was made to both metallized surfaces of the diamond. For emission measurements, a vacuum gap was introduced between the hydrogenated surface of the diamond and the secondary electrode using Kapton insulation. The mount could be cooled via LN2 lines and included a thermocouple for temperature measurement. The power supplies on both the primary and secondary electrodes were capable of measuring currents of 5nA-ImA. The primary electrode was slightly positively biased to prevent escape of secondary electrons produced by the beam from the metal layer. The secondary electrode was positively biased with respect to the primary. In TM, the field in the diamond was taken to be the potential difference (Vsee-V prim) divided by the thickness of the diamond (tdia). In EM, the field in the diamond is: neck -Vprim Fltamnnd (1) 5.7t, vac +1dia Here tvac is the thickness of the vacuum gap, and 5.7 is the dielectric constant of diamond. The measured gain is the ratio of the current measured on the secondary \\nelectrode to the current emitted by the electron gun. The primary electron beam on the diamond was estimated to be ~Imm in diameter. GAIN MEASUREMENTS Natural Diamond The type Ila natural sample was metallized on both sides with 30 nm of Al via evaporation. The electron gain was studied in TM at 293K (figure 4) and 81K (figure 5) for a variety of primary energies and primary currents. For EM measurements (figure 6) the Al was etched and replaced with gold on one face prior to hydrogenation. 300. 100nA 50nA + 20nA 10nA 600 Ip=100nA,--81K 250. 3 500 200. a m5kev keV 4keV Primary a 400. keV 150 02 keV 300 a t 100 eV Primary 200. 3 50 2keVPrimary 6 100 evPrimary 0 0 Field (MV/m) Field (MV/m) FIGURE 4&5.
